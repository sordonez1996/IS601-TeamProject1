#Git Branch Command


•	The git branch command creates, lists and deletes branches. It doesn’t allow switching between branches or putting a forked history back together again. Thus, git branch is integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.


•	Branching is an available feature in most version control systems. Git branches are a pointer to a snapshot of the changes you have made. A new branch is created to encapsulate the changes when you want to fix bugs or add new features. This helps you to clean up the future's history before merging it. Git branches are an essential part of everyday workflow. Git does not copy files from one directory to another, it stores the branch as a reference to a commit.


•	Branches represent an isolated line of development. They are accepted as a way to request a new working directory, staging area and project history. Developing isolated lines of development for two features in branches will enable to operate on them in parallel and make the master branch free from questionable code.

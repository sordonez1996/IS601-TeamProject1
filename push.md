#Git Push Command


•	The git push command uploads the content of the local repository to the remote repository. Pushing is the opposite of fetching. If git fetch imports the content to the local branches, git push exports it to the remote branches.


•	The git push command is commonly used to publish the upload local changes to the central repository. After the changes are made in the local repository, you can git push to share the modification with other members of the team. The git push command is one of the commands that are involved in the "syncing" process. These commands work on the remote branches that are configured with the git remote command. The commits are uploaded with git push and download with git fetch and git pull. After making changes in both cases, git merge is used to integrate changes.

•	The diagram below shows the progression of the local master past the central repository’s master and publishing changes by invoking git push origin master.
